# KirkMcdonald's Factorio Calculator

It's a Factorio Calculator. See:

https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/

## Factorio version

The current release is developed for Factorio version `0.16.37`.

## Running locally

While this project is plain HTML, JS & CSS, you need to run a local webserver to use the calculator locally to allow fetching the requires resources via AJAX.

If you have Python2 installed locally (macOS has python 2 locally installed by default), you can start a simple HTTP server:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
